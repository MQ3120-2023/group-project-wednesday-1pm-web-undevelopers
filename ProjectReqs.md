# Group Project Requirements

In your group project, you will collaborate to build a real web application. This project serves several purposes:

1. **Project Planning and Execution:** It assesses your ability to plan and execute a web development project.

2. **Group Collaboration:** It evaluates your capacity to work in a group, communicate effectively, and cooperate to achieve common goals.

3. **Application Development:** It tests your ability to apply your web development knowledge to design and deliver a prototype application.

## Your Group

Your group should consist of 3 or 4 members. You will work collectively on the project but should distribute various tasks among group members. This can involve assigning responsibilities such as back-end and front-end development or a mix of roles.

Group work in a university context often raises concerns about unequal contributions. To address this, we will monitor how each group collaborates and gather feedback on individual contributions.

## Your Project

Your task is to develop a web application using React. The application should have some complexity, but since you have limited time to complete the prototype, consider that your full vision for the application may exceed the scope of the proposed prototype. You must describe your concept and create a plan for the prototype.

In terms of project size, aim for a scope similar to an individual assignment project but with more complexity and additional features. Avoid developing another online store; explore different ideas. Additionally, you can incorporate third-party APIs into your application, such as Auth0 for authentication or external data sources like Google Maps or Transport NSW live data.

## Your Plan

You need to provide a proposal document by the end of Week 8. This document should include an overview of your proposed application and a detailed plan for achieving its implementation, including milestones. There will be three milestone checkpoints during weeks 10-12, where you will present your progress and outline your plans for the following week. Your initial plan should specify what you intend to deliver at each of these milestone meetings, with the flexibility to update plans as needed based on your progress.

## GitHub Repository

You should work within a group GitHub repository created using a provided link. The first group member to follow the link should create a group with the same name as your iLearn group (e.g., Group A), and others should select that group when connecting. Your use of GitHub is crucial, as we will assess and grade your contributions and collaboration within the repository.

## Project Timeline

Here is the project timeline:

- **Week 8:**
  - Proposal document due (worth 3%)
- **Week 9:**
  - Sprint Report 1
- **Week 10:**
  - Sprint Report 2
- **Week 11:**
  - Sprint Report 3
- **Week 12:**
  - Sprint Report 4
- **End of Week 13:**
  - Final Deliverable and Demos in workshops (worth 20%)

Please note that the project timeline is tight, and you should be prepared to adapt your plans as you encounter challenges or make progress.

## Grading

The grading for this project will be as follows:

- Proposal and project plan/milestones (week 7, worth 3%)
- Sprint checkpoints each week (weeks 9, 10, 11, 12, worth 12%)
- Individual reflective report (week 13, worth 5%)
- Final deliverable, code for review, contributions report, deployment report (week 13, worth 20%)
- All group marks for the final deliverable will be scaled by contribution if necessary.

## Final Submission Requirements

Your final submission is due on Sunday, November 5th, at 11:55 pm. For the final submission, you need to:

- Submit your Individual Reflective Report via TurnitIn in the iLearn Assessment section.
- Complete the self and peer assessment of your group in TEAMMATES (link will be provided via email).

As for the project itself, there is no explicit submission. We will evaluate your GitHub repository, which should include:

- `README.md`: A description of your project, including an outline of the application, target users, data sources, and more (similar to the proposal).
- A reference to your second GitHub repository if used.
- A description of what you have achieved in this MVP, using your milestones to highlight your progress.
- A guide to the project source code, indicating where to find different components.
- A summary of your next steps if you were to continue the project.
- A summary of the main roles and contributions of each team member, along with how you managed interaction and communication throughout the project.

Additionally, include a file named `DEPLOYMENT.md` with the following details:

- A link to a deployed version of your application if available.
- Information on how to run and build the project, including instructions for someone taking over development.
- Details about any use of Continuous Integration.

Create a folder named `SCREENSHOTS` containing screenshots or videos of key pages in your application. Include a `README.md` file within this folder to describe what each screenshot or video demonstrates.

Please note that we will review your code and read these documents, but we may not run your application during the grading process. Use the screenshots to showcase your design.

This portion of the submission is worth 20 out of the 40 marks for this assignment, and marks will be allocated based on project management, technical achievement, design, and conception.
