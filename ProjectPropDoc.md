## Introduction
In this proposal, our group aims to develop a Recipe Management Web Application, designed to enhance the culinary experiences of cooking enthusiasts. The application will cater to home cooks, food lovers, busy professionals, and those with specific dietary restrictions. Our primary data source will be TheMealDB API, providing a vast database of ingredients and recipes.

## Proposed Web Application

### Main Purpose
The web application's primary goal is to offer an efficient and user-friendly solution for exploring, discovering, and organizing recipes digitally. Users can search for recipes, save favorites in a personalized virtual recipe book, and streamline meal planning and preparation.

### Target User Group and Usage
The target audience includes working-class individuals like students and parents, who seek an easy-to-use solution for meal planning and cooking with the ingredients at hand.

### Features and Functionality
1. **User Authentication:** Users can create accounts or sign in using existing credentials, utilizing Auth0 for security.
2. **Ingredient Selection:** Users can select ingredients from a predefined list or search the database.
3. **Recipe Recommendations:** The application suggests recipes based on selected ingredients, sorted by matching ingredients.
4. **Recipe Details:** Users can view detailed instructions, full ingredient lists, and other important information.
5. **Save and Share:** Users can save favorite recipes and share them through social media or email.

### Data Sources
We will use TheMealDB API to fetch a variety of recipes, including ingredients, preparation steps, and images.

## Target Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
The MVP aims to simplify meal decision-making. Users input available ingredients, and the website returns matching recipes. Users can save favorites for future reference, and a ranking system helps prioritize recipes.

### Excluded Features in MVP
Due to API limitations, some features, such as adding custom meals, are excluded due to time constraints.
